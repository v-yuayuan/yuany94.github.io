I am excited about exploring cutting-edge areas in computational social science, in particular, empirical analyses and theoretical explanations of human behaviors in large-scale social networks. Before joining MIT, I received my Bachelor degrees in computer science and economics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, under the supervision of Prof. Jie Tang. \r\n\r\n### Manuscripts and Publications\r\n* **Yuan Yuan**, Yan Leng, Xiaowen Dong, Alex Pentland, and Jie Tang, ``Viral red packets: cascade of giving behavior in WeChat groups'', submitted to the proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (WWW'18).\r\n* **Yuan Yuan**, Alex Pentland, ``Social network formation and social representation'', working paper.\r\n* **Yuan Yuan**, Tracy Xiao Liu, Chenhao Tan, Jie Tang, ``Online red packet: large-scale observational study of gift-giving'', working paper.\r\n\r\nolder work:\r\n* **Yuan Yuan**, Sihong Xie, Chun-Ta Lu, Jie Tang, and Philip, S.
